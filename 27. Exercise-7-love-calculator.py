Friendship Score Calculator

Instructions:
1. Ask two people for their names.
2. Convert the names to lowercase.
3. Count the occurrences of the letters in the word "friend":
   - f, r, i, e, n, d
4. Count the occurrences of the letters in the word "ship":
   - s, h, i, p
   (Note that the letter "i" appears in both words and is counted twice.)
5. Concatenate the two counts to form the friendship score.
6. Display a message based on the score:
   - If the score is less than 10 or greater than 90:
         "Your friendship score is X%, you are best friends forever!"
   - If the score is between 40 and 60:
         "Your friendship score is X%, you are pretty solid pals!"
   - Otherwise, simply display the friendship score.
